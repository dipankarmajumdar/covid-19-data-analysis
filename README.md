# ðŸ“‚ COVID-19 Data Analysis and Visualization

## Overview

This project provides an in-depth analysis and visualization of COVID-19 data to uncover trends, insights, and patterns. Using data from the [Our World in Data](https://covid.ourworldindata.org/data/owid-covid-data.csv), the analysis focuses on key metrics such as total cases, deaths, vaccination progress, and mortality rates. The project employs Python libraries like Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Plotly for data manipulation and visualization.

## Dependencies

To run this project, ensure you have the following dependencies installed:

- Python 3.8 or higher
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Plotly
- Jupyter Notebook

### Step-by-Step Guide to Running the Project

1. **Clone the Repository**:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/dipankarmajumdar/covid-19-data-analysis.git
cd covid-19-data-analysis
```

2. **Install Dependencies**: Run the following command to install all required libraries:

```sh
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

3. **Launch Jupyter Notebook**: Start Jupyter Notebook in the project directory:

```sh
jupyter notebook
```

4. **Open the Notebook**: Open the `covid-19-data-analysis.ipynb` file in Jupyter Notebook.
5. **Run the Notebook**: Execute the cells sequentially to load the dataset, clean the data, and generate visualizations.

### Key Findings and Insights

1. **Top 10 Countries by Total Cases and Deaths**:

- The analysis identifies countries with the highest total cases and deaths, providing insights into the global impact of COVID-19.

2. **Global Trends**:

- Visualizations show the progression of total cases and vaccination efforts over time.

3. **Mortality Rates**:

- A comparison of mortality rates across countries highlights regions with higher fatality rates.

4. **Vaccination Progress**:

- Interactive maps and bar plots reveal the vaccination progress globally and by country.

5. **Country-Specific Trends**:

- Detailed analysis of daily new cases for specific countries, such as India.
